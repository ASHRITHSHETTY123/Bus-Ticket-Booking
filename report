The Main aim of Bus ticket Management Mini DBMS project is for bus agencies to keep records of busses and the drivers or the conductors. We aim to demonstrate the use of create, read, update and delete MySQL operations through this project. This project starts by adding details of employee either a driver or a conductor and then adding bus details.The agency will have the customer details whose registration is done.The user can add bus details with the route.

\chapter{Introduction}
\par
Information and communication are the essential part of human life. The demand for the
food, cloth, etc. are increasing with respect to the increasing population, to which
researchers and scientists are trying to find innovative solutions.in India the major source
of income is the agriculture itself hence its known as “land of agriculture”. Ever since
people learned to grow crops, harvest them and sell them to market, they have tried to
increase the profit by seeking information from others. But the information gained by
farmers over the centuries is not adequate to grow crops in the varying weather condition,
soil fertility, pests and diseases. This has raised the need for the latest information which
allows the farmers to deal with these changes smoothly.
\par
There is a huge demand in the market for web services based on agriculture. The
applications with varying requirements help the agriculturist to do several jobs like
designs, decision making, chemical analyses, and GPS centred services etc. Portable
devices provide an appropriate information entree point and are convenient to be carried
everywhere.
\par
\section{Purpose}
The Main objective of the Bus Ticket Booking Management mini-project is to ease the process of booking tickets 
and keeping track of buses and employees. This management system will drastically reduce the manual work in 
bus ticket booking centers and travel agencies. The customers will visit the travel agency to book tickets. The 
travel agency will then use the management system and keep track of its customers and their payments. Along 
with this they will also be able to manage the employee details, bus details and route details. Through this project, 
we aim to demonstrate the use of create, insert, update and delete MySQL operations.
\section{Scope}
The resource management for large number of nodes is quite difficulty from aspect of configuration, deployment and efficient resource utilization. This model will select best configuration for job using MapReduce profiling. This resource management technique includes cost-aware resource provisioning, VMaware scheduling and online virtual machine reconfiguration.
\section{Overview}
Bus ticket management system lets the bus agencies to keep track of the users.Various new concepts are implemented in this proposed system.HTML,CSS for designing and front end development of the system.Most popular technology nowadays in the fields of web development,PHP is implemented having the major role in validation and for whole processing.With the help of documentation it's very much easy for the any third party to understand the system.

\section{ER Diagram}

\caption{System Architecture Diagram}
\end{figure}
Employee works for the agency,and the agency assign the bus to the employee.the Bus has the fixed route and the customer makes the payment.the Customer travels through specific route.
\section{Mapping From ER Diagram to Schema Diagram}
Figure 3.2 represent the relational schema of the proposed system.We create the relation employee,bus,routes,customer,payment in the relational schema corresponding to the regular entities in the ER diagram.EMPID,BUSID,CUSID,PAYMENTID are the primary key for the relation employee,bus,routes,customer,payment.
\section{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item One bus can have multiple employees.
	\item One route can have multiple customers.
	\item one bus can have multiple payments.
	
\end{itemize}
\section{Schema Diagram}
A data flow diagram(DFD) is a graphical representation of the "flow" of data through an information system .DFDs can also be for the visualization of data processing.On a DFD, data items flow from an external data source or an internal data store to an internal data store or an external data sink, via an internal process. A DFD provides no information about the timing or ordering of processes, or about whether processes will operate in sequence or in parallel.It is therefore quite different from a flowchart , which shows the flow of control through an algorithm, allowing users to determine what operations will be performed, in what order, and under what circumstances, but not what kinds of data will be input to and output from the system,nor where the data will come from and go to, nor where the data will be stored.

\chapter{Conclusion and Future work}
BUS TICKET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is a web based application.Which has high integrity to change the current problems and system failure.Also the same system with some basic and minute changes in programming and interface can be implemented for users also who can book ticket .From our project experience we have experienced that computerized system id more helpful rather than the traditional way of storing data.It helped us to get in depth knowledge about how system is planned,organized and managed.it's not everyone's cup of tea to manage such a huge transportation system so,by implementing BUS TICKET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM things are going to get much better.
